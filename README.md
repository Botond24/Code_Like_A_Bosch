# Code Like A Bosch Challenge
## Hardware Chalenge
### Ideas
- lapma
- toldo
- nyomatek kijelzo
- Nekem az ötletem a szogmérő, ezt 2 dologra is használhatjuk
    - Egyrészt segíthet kezdőknek hogy jól tartsák a fúrót
    - Másrészt vízszint mérő

### TODO -- Moved to Obsidian/Main doc.md

1. Brainstorm and decide on an idea that can enhance the Bosch 12 screwdriver
    - Business model of your solution
    - Customer need for your extension – how many new customers could be acquired with the new extension
    - Value added for the customer – comfort, safety, efficiency, versatility
    - Feasibility – is this can be really realized?
    - Costs – development, BOM, sale price
2. Overview of the proposed solution – block diagram, infographics, etc.
3. Schematic of the proposed solution – the real connection between the components, modules, can be done in CAD, or in paint.
4. Simulations and calculations of the main component, or part of the hardware (if applicable)
5. Documentation of your idea and solution
6. Firmware block diagram (only if applicable to your idea)
7. Firmware code, or segment of your algorithm (only if applicable to your idea)
8. Explain your idea and introduce your team in a video
9. Optional for additional points: start prototyping and bring your idea to life with the provided tools, hardware components on site (HW + firmware)
